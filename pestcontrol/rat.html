These rodents can enter the house without much difficulty by using a door, a hole in the wall, or the sewage pipes. They are not difficult to locate and can be discovered in a variety of locations, including homes, schools, garages, commercial complexes, etc. They can easily range in size from a small rat all the way up to a large rat. The nighttime activity of the rodent, such as a mouse or rat, is unrestricted. By biting on things like paper, wires, and clothing, they are causing damage.

    <h2>Preventing Rat Infestations</h2>
    <p>The most effective method for preventing rat infestations is to provide as little shelter and storage as possible, as this is likely to entice rats and other rodents. It is important to plug up as many openings and crevices as you can find on the exterior of the house where rats could gain access. It is recommended that the following guidelines be adhered to in order to help prevent rats from entering your home in search of the food and shelter it offers: If it is at all possible, you should remove any piles of debris, stones, bricks, or other materials that are located close to the foundation of your home. These piles serve as harborages for rodents. Patch up any holes or cracks that are more than a quarter of an inch wide. If you want to prevent rodents from entering your home through large holes or cracks, you should first stuff them with steel wool or wire mesh before sealing the openings with caulk or foam.</p>
