    <h2>Bed Bug Extermination</h2>
    <p>Adult bedbugs are 5 mm long. They are usually found in bedrooms but hide in cracks and crevices during the day. They are a flattened oval shape and light brown before feeding, but rounder and darker after. They are nocturnal and are drawn to both the warmth of our bodies and the carbon dioxide in our breath. The most common places for bedbugs to hide are in mattress seams, crevices in the bed frame, behind furniture surrounding the bed (especially the headboard), and where the wall meets the floor. Bed bugs give off an unpleasant smell when they are infested, so you will need to use bed bug control services to get rid of them.</p>
    <h2>Working Methodology</h2>
    <p>Bed bugs are an obnoxious pest and one of the most difficult to eradicate. Deep cleaning, exceptional hygiene, and the use of insecticides will all help to keep bedbug numbers under control at elvinbhai.com. However, professional bed bug control treatments will be required to eradicate the infestation. Bites may not be itchy at the beginning of a bed bug infestation, making the situation difficult to read.

    <h2>Things We Expect You to Do Before and After Bed Bug Treatments</h2>
    <p>Bed sheets should be taken off, divan drawers should be emptied, and the headboards and base sections should be moved apart.
